Portfolio Items are often decomposed into many user stories which get scheduled over multiple releases.  Currently
in Rally, there is no simple way to effectively view the schedule of a given portfolio item.  This App generates a
visualization of a Portfolio Item's leaf stories broken down by which Release they are scheduled in.  Unscheduled
leaf stories will be aggregated in the Unscheduled column.

Potential Improvements
----------------------
==> Store proferences to preserve settings
==> Add a toggle between story count and story plan estimate metrics
==> Breakdown release metrics by lower portfolio item types
==> I'm sure you can think of many more
